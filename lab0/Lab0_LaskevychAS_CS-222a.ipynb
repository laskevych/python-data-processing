    "maintenance of relations with Iraq. Later, Jordan restored its relations with Western countries through its\n",

    "\n",
    "### Military\n",
    "\n",
    "The first organised army in Jordan was established on 22 October 1920, and was named the \"Arab Legion\". The Legion grew\n",
    "from 150 men in 1920 to 8,000 in 1946. Jordan's capture of the West Bank during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War proved that\n",
    "the Arab Legion, known today as the Jordan Armed Forces, was the most effective among the Arab troops involved in the\n",
    "war. The Royal Jordanian Army, which boasts around 110,000 personnel, is considered to be among the most professional in\n",
    "the region, due to being particularly well-trained and organised. The Jordanian military enjoys strong support and aid\n",
    "from the United States, the United Kingdom and France. This is due to Jordan's critical position in the Middle East. The\n",
    "development of Special Operations Forces has been particularly significant, enhancing the capability of the military to\n",
    "react rapidly to threats to homeland security, as well as training special forces from the region and beyond. Jordan\n",
    "provides extensive training to the security forces of several Arab countries."
